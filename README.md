# Italy-Road-Networks

This network consists of nodes representing different locations in Italy and edges representing roads connecting those locations.

By analyzing degree centrality and betweenness centrality, we can identify nodes that are highly connected or serve as critical points in the road network, that will help to determine traffic flow. Then, we also got assortativity which indicates whether nodes tend to connect to others with similar degrees. A positive value suggests a tendency for hubs to connect to other hubs, while a negative value suggests a preference for hubs to connect to less connected nodes. And then, Connected Components also tells us how many separate regions of connected roads exist within the network. More connected components might indicate more isolated road networks within Italy.

Overall by examining these values, we can gain insights into the structure of the road network in Italy, including which nodes are crucial for connectivity within the network.
